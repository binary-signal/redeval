Theoretical alignment work can be more conceptual or more mathematical\\\\\\\\u2014the output of math work tends to be a proof of a theorem or a new mathematic framework, whereas in conceptual work math is used as one (very good) tool to tell if a problem has been solved. Conceptual work is more philosophical. A PhD is not required but is helpful.",
