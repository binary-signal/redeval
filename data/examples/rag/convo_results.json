It explains that the document discusses two main types of alignment work: theoretical alignment work and empirical alignment work. It further elaborates on the nature and focus of each type of alignment work.\nYou could also spend ~50 hours reading up on a specific topic in mathematical AI alignment that interests you (you can see some of the literature here), then spend ~50 hours trying to say something new and interesting about that topic (or distilling, if saying something new is too hard).\nFinally, you could do a research internship with a mathematical researcher in an area related to mathematical alignment (or do research directly on alignment, but only if your supervisor already works on that). Ctrl+F for \u201cResearch experience is essential for research leads, and useful for research contributors\u201d for advice on getting research experience. You might be able to reach out to mathematical alignment researchers for an internship. Perhaps after writing something, as above.\nIt\u2019s worth bearing in mind that pursuing theoretical alignment work is much riskier than ML-focused work, because you\u2019ll build fewer transferable skills than ML work, you\u2019ll have less credibility outside the alignment community, and the infrastructure for this work is just starting to be built. That said, if you think you could have a good fit, it might be worth testing it out!\n\nHow to pursue conceptual alignment research: Again, I don\u2019t really know. For that reason, getting mentorship seems pretty important. If you can produce something, perhaps from one of the exercises above, I think Mark Xu or Evan Hubinger would consider chatting with you and giving you career advice. Here are some short-to-medium-term options: work independently on a grant (or at an existing organisation, though you\u2019d probably need a PhD for that), work at ARC or MIRI (not sure whether MIRI is hiring as of June 2022), apprentice under a conceptual researcher, or do a PhD (in math/CS theory, with a smart and open professor who\u2019s regularly publishing in COLT or FOCS or similar. You probably won\u2019t be able to publish conceptual alignment work during a PhD, but you might build useful skills). My guess is that mentorship should be the main consideration early on in your career: if you can work with and get mentored by a strong conceptual alignment researcher, that is probably better than a PhD (unless you have the opportunity to work closely with a really strong or value-aligned advisor), and a good PhD probably looks better than independent work.",
